# Ideas

## Combat

Add a 'cleave' mechanic, where if something does overkill damage, 
and there are nearby damagable objects (with option for friendly fire or not),
they also recieve some of the leftover damage

Actors can have states applied to them:

  * Burning (inflicts damage over time, adds fire damage to any attacks and has risk of spreading to nearby burnable things)
  * Mad (see enemies where there are none. See allies as enemies)
  * Poison (deal damage over time - heals undead)
  * X-ray vision (see through walls)
  * Blind (reduced vision down to 1-2 tiles)
  * Drunk/Dizzy (motion is all backwards)
  * Healing (gain health over time - does damage to undead)
  * Enraged

## Classes

Knight: Slow movement, block, swords, shields
Ranger: Fast movement, dodge (roll), daggers/bows
Wizard: Medium movement, spells, spells

(Unlockable other cool ideas)
Wraith: Medium movement, doesn't trigger traps, spells, undead
Savage: Fast movement, can transform into animals, and use their abilities, no weapons

(When character dies in multiplayer)
Ghost: Medium movement, cannot attack, can move through walls.


## Enemies

Little gobliny-slimey monster things (laarl) like spikey frogs that jump at you
Magical monster (darkflies?) that spreads darkness, blinding enemies
Mole-y/badger-y electric monster (skolatsi?) that paralyse things around them upon their death (but are otherwise kinda weak and won't attack players)
Spider-y snake-y thing that spits poison

Slug-like things that heal on impact (as a self-defence against undead)

Ranged skeletons (throwing bones?)
Summoners and their summons (summons die if summoner dies)


## Traps

What happens when a boulder goes over spikes?
What happens when a boulder goes through/into a swinging trap?

Two boulders cancel each other out (destroy each other)

Add a flamethrower trap?

## Multiplayer

It would be great to have multiplayer
At least local - I think that was planned anyway.
