# Roadmap

  * Add win condition (leaving level)
  * Add fake wall objects (that can be destroyed)
  * Test projectile interactions with with world (eg. Do boulders trigger other boulders? Do arrows damage fake walls?)
  * Add some better (but maybe still placeholder) graphics for tiles and characters
  * Add enemy generation to level generation
  * Add treasure containers (chests, barrels - floor type dependant) to level generation
  * Add player actions (roll, block, attacks, interact, use item, etc...)
  * Add player dealing damage (eg. to fake walls and destroyable objects like barrels)
  * Add basic enemy AI, where they will move towards the player if they can see them, and attack if in range
  * Add equipment to player (weapons and armour) and have them change attack (speed and damage) and resistances
  * Add item drops on treasure container destruction (or opening)
